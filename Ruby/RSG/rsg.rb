# random sentence.
# Note that the algorithm to traverse the data structure and

# expansion. It will not necessarily be the first definition in the file,
# but it will always be defined eventually. Your code can
# assume that the grammar files are syntactically correct

# as described above, don't have some sort of endless recursive cycle in the
# expansion, etc.). The names of non-terminals should be considered
# case-insensitively, <NOUN> matches <Noun> and <noun>, for example.
